- Epic Game News is my Gaming News Website. The Website is done, getting updates from time to tipe. The code is inside a private repository because I do not want to share the code publicly. The website is made with the Laravel Framework.
- Check out the WebSite here: **[Epic Game News](https://www.epicgamenews.com/)**
- The next project is recreating the front side of the website in React. Checkout more information [Epic Game News React Info](https://github.com/laurentiucozma12/epic-game-news-reactjs)
